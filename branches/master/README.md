# AMWA NMOS Grouping Recommendations

This repository is used to document best practice and recommendations,
for how to indicate and handle Groups of Resources in [AMWA NMOS APIs](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos).

Currently this addresses "Natural Groups",
i.e. those created by the default operation of a Node/Device,
and not user- or automation-defined Groups.
